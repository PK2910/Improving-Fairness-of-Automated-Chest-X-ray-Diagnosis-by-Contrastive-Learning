#  Imporving Fairness of Automated Chest X ray Diagnosis by Contrastive Learning
### Overview
Welcome to the Chest X-ray Contrastive Learning project! This initiative aims to employ contrastive learning techniques to mitigate bias in chest X-ray diagnosis. The project focuses on training a model to emphasize the differences between images, thereby reducing biases in medical image predictions.
